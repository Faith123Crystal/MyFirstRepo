["What I have learned from this course"]
I've learned so much about Git and GitHub in this course! Understanding how to work with branches has been particularly valuable - it allows me to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase. The pull request workflow has shown me how teams collaborate effectively, reviewing each other's code before merging changes. I'm excited to continue learning more advanced Git features and contribute to open source projects.
